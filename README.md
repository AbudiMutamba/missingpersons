# Kidnappings & Missing Persons Uganda

This is a possible list of Ugandans who might get arrested, detained, kidnapped, or go missing following the planned #March2Parliament protests on July 23, 2024

## How to contribute? 

To contribute edit `data.json` with correct details of the person that's been reported or presumed missing, arrested or detained and send PR.

Example:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Missing Person 1",
        "image": "img/image_of_person.jpeg",
        "last_known_location": "Kamwokya",
        "security_organ": "Police, Army, Intelligence",
        "twitter": "@handle_of_person",
        "sex": "male"
    }
]
```

Add their image to `\img` first then update `data.json` and send PR.

Styling PRs are allowed too.
